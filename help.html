<h3>Get location</h3>
	Click on the "Get my location" button to get your location and put it on the map with the red marker "M". 
	The location details are also shown in the boxes at the top of the screen.
	If using a desktop/laptop device connected to the internet but without GPS, the location may be 
	approximate, or sometimes wildly incorrect.
<h3>MemCode</h3>
	Fill in the six boxes with the six 3-letter words that form the MemCode - the program automatically adds the separators, 
	which do not have to be entered. Click the "...use" button to the right, to convert this a HexCode and to latitude 
	and longitude. Click the "Put on map" button to show the location on the map, marked with a blue "D".
<h3>HexCode</h3>
	The box shows the 12-digit hexadecimal code for the currently active location. If you enter a code in the 
	box and click the "...use" button to the right, this code will be converted to a MemCode and to latitude 
	and longitude. If fewer that 12 digits are entered they are padded to the right, in order to place the location at 
	the middle of the larger region specified. If more than 12 digits are entered they are truncated to 12.
<h3>Latitude and Longitude</h3>
	The boxes show the calculated latitude and longitude (in degrees) for the currently active location, rounded 
	to 5 figures. If you enter values here and click the "...use" button to the right, this code will be converted 
	to a MemCode and HexCode. Latitude must be in the range -90<sup>o</sup> to 90<sup>o</sup>, and longitude in 
	the range -180<sup>o</sup> to 360<sup>o</sup> (if a longitude greater than 180<sup>o</sup> is entered, then 360<sup>o</sup> 
	is subtracted to bring it into the preferred range from -180<sup>o</sup> to 180<sup>o</sup>).
<h3>Map</h3>
	The BING map may be moved and scaled in the usual way. Click anywhere on the map to show the MemCode for that location, 
	which is marked on the map with a green "C". The location details are also shown in the boxes at the top of the screen.
